Setup nginx on windoof
======================

Download "https://nginx.org/en/download.html"

Unpack wherever you want. This tuto assumes APP_DIR.

  APP_DIR="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.opt\nginx-VERSION\"

Bakup original config file to "nginx.conf.skel".

Replace config file by:

worker_processes  1;
error_log  logs/error.log;
events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
  include       mime.types;
  default_type  application/octet-stream;
  sendfile        on;
  keepalive_timeout  65;
  server {
      # For public access use "8080" and "[::]:8080"
      listen       127.0.0.1:8080;
      server_name  localhost;
      location / {
          root   srv/html;
          index  index.html index.htm;
      }
  }
}

Make sure dirs chosen in config do exist. nginx won't start bcause he
cannot find the files due to the dirs are missing.

Start server by launching "nginx.exe". HINT: working dir MUST be same
dir where the exe file resides.
