How to fu** this bastard cloud/online shit
==========================================


## Get package

- [Get if from here](https://github.com/portapps/postman-portable/releases/tag/10.15.0-57)
  (Yep, old version, because newer versions seem to not allow this anymore at all)


## Get back the local save feature

- Open DevTools (Ctrl-Shift-I)
- Type into the console `pm.settings.setSetting("offlineAPIClientEnabled",0)`
  (this will turn off the lightweight client and switch to ScratchPad)
- Restart Postman (you'll see briefly the ScratchPad interface but it will be
  hidden with a login screen then)
- Open DevTools again (Ctrl-Shift-I)
- Type into the console `pm.mediator.trigger("hideUserSwitchingExperienceModal")`
