<p>A fancy template for portable (as in responsive) documents which in
its core are as simple as reading as a pure text file. But at the same
time have a convenient default opening action in the browser where it
looks like a regular A4 sheet, or auto adjusting size which allows it to
be readable on any kind of portable devices like smartphones with small
screens. But in addition, is also easily printed to A4. Without much
headache of printing ahlot of unwanted bullshit.</p>
