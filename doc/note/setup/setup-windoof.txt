Setup Windoof in a experiment VM
================================

Install system STRICTLY WITHOUT internet connection.

Stop annoying windoof auto updates. Make sure to use windoof newlines (CRLF) in
the reg file:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU]
"NoAutoUpdate"=dword:00000001

curl -sSD- http://10.0.2.9:80/stop-annoying-updates.reg -O

Download/Install:
- "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete"
- "https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"

Install needed software (Maybe: firefox, MsOffice, MsTeams, ..?).

Manually trigger updates, reboot, updates, reboot, (likely some more turns ...)

Configure Performance options. Disable all but screen fonts.

Disable auto-defragmentation, as this renders all kind of snapshotting
effort useless -> Win -> "Defrag.." -> Disable scheduler.

Make sure no more updates are running. Then, I guess best is to reboot without
internet access once more to cleanup the disk. Delete unused files like
trashcan or downloaded installers.

- Use "Disc Clean".
- Defrag disk.
- sdelete64.exe -nobanner -z C:

Shutdown win guest, then compact disc (HINT this removes BaseImg):

  qemu-img convert -O qcow2 input.qcow output.qcow2

Image is ready.
