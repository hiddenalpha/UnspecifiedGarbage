Setup a Fedora VM
=================

Dload fedora server netinst iso from
https://fedoraproject.org/server/download
. Launch a VM from that installer iso. In the installer, take care of
those settings:
- Keyboard.
- DisableRoot.
- Create "user" with default PW, with groups "wheel,adm".
- "Advanced" Disk partition.
- 1x 1MiB "bios" partition.
- 1x ext4 at "/"
- TODO forgotten anything?

Wait for installation to complete. Reboot machine. Created user should
already work via SSH.

  && $SUDO dnf install -y vim \

Enable "%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" in "/etc/sudoers".

Add exitCode to PS1 in "~/.bashrc".

  && $SUDO dnf clean all \
  && $SUDO fstrim -av \

Sparsify disk image from host as usual.
Packaging.
