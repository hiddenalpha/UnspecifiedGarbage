## Print why a package is installed

  apt-cache rdepends --no-suggests --no-conflicts --no-breaks --no-replaces \
      --no-enhances --installed --recurse \
      ${PKG_NAME:?}

WARN: I saw cases where above still misses to print relevant packages. Then I
      found another hack-around which did work for me. Just pretent to
      uninstall the package. Then the list might give some hints why it
      was installed:

  sudo apt purge --dry-run ${PKG_NAME:?}
