How to GnuPG
============

WARN: You MUST only use those instructions if you know exactly what
you're doing! If you don't, you MUST NOT use those instructions!


## Prepare for a master key creation

- Choose a storage medium which will keep the master key and will be
  kept VERY SAVE somewhere (also think for some redundancy). WARN: If
  you choose a medium which probably could fail, you will be screwed up
  in a later point in time!
- Choose how (or where?) to keep master passphrase.


## Initialize a new master key

  export GNUPGHOME=/mnt/your/master/.gnupg
  gpg --full-gen-key


## Add additional identities (as needed)

  export GNUPGHOME=/mnt/your/master/.gnupg
  gpg --edit-key foo@example.com
  gpg> adduid
  gpg> save


## Create keys for some daily-use devices

  export GNUPGHOME=/mnt/your/master/.gnupg
  gpg --edit-key foo@example.com
  # Add ONE shared encryption key
  gpg> addkey    (then choose "encryp only")
  # Add signing key foreach device you plan to use
  gpg> addkey    (then choose "sign only")
  gpg> addkey    (then choose "sign only")
  gpg> addkey    (then choose "sign only")


## Export subkeys for use on a daily-use device

  export GNUPGHOME=/mnt/your/master/.gnupg
  # Print list of what we have
  gpg --edit-key foo@example.com quit
  # For each device choose one encrypt and one sign key and replace F00 and BA5
  # below with them.
  gpg --export-secret-subkeys F00! BA5! > keys-for-device


## Import prepared subkeys on daily-use device

  gpg --import keys-for-device
  gpg --edit-key foo@example.com
  gpg> trust
  gpg> save
