Connect host java debugger to JVM inside VM
===========================================

Make sure host can reach guest port.

  hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:${DBG_PORT:?}-:1241

Make debugger listen on that port.

  -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=*:1241

Now debugger is reachable from host via DBG_PORT.
