SSH Setup & Key Management
==========================

## Create New Ssh Key

Create "path/to/key" and "path/to/key.pub" as a 2048 bit RSA with
"your comment" as comment (you can skip "-C comment" if you dont care).

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f path/to/key -C "your comment"
```


## Change Passphrase

```sh
ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/key
```

NOTE: Just hitting enter when asked for the new one will remove the passphrase.


## Inspect keys

Print public key hash:
```sh
ssh-keygen -l -f path/to/key.pub
```

Print public key hash as md5:
```sh
ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f path/to/key.pub
```

```sh
ssh-keygen -y -f path/to/key > path/to/key.pub
```

## Remove obsolete entry from known_hosts

  ssh-keygen -f path/to/known_hosts -R "example.com"


## TODO

 -e      This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file
         and print to stdout a public key in one of the formats
         specified by the -m option.  The default export format is
         “RFC4716”.  This option allows exporting OpenSSH keys for
         use by other programs, including several commercial SSH
         implementations.
